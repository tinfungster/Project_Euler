# Project Euler Websites! 

### If you don't have Pluto Notebooks installed on your computer ( what a shame ) , you can look at my Project Euler Websites! 
##### They are like a snapshot of Pluto Notebooks. The website can display the code cells with the code with the results. The only problem is that they are static, which means you cannot tweak the code to see how it works and you cannot interact with it. This is why I recommend you to install Pluto on your computer.

# Have fun!

If you are curious, the website is based on HTML ( an awful programming language ) and this file is actually a Markdown file!
